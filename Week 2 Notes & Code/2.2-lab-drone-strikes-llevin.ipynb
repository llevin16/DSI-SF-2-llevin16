    "    \n",
    "This dataset is challenging for a variety of reasons. It is not cleaned up - there are missing cells. Relationships between variables are more complicated. A lot of the variables are in string format, and if you are interested in them, may need to be \"recoded\" as binary 1 vs. 0 in a new column.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a group you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and clean the data with pandas. You will probably want to remove variables you are not interested first so that cleaning is easier.\n",
    "2. Identify variables and subsets of the data your are interested in as a group.\n",
    "2. Describe the data and investigate any outliers for those variables.\n",
    "3. Explore relationships between variables.\n",
    "4. Visualize at least three variables of your choice with appropriate visualizations. They should be understandable.\n",
    "5. Visualize subsets of the variables you chose, subsetted conditional on some other variable. For example, number of civillians killed by area.\n",
    "6. Write a brief report on at least 5 things you found interesting about the data or, if it doesn't interest you at all, things you found out and why they are boring."
